Overview
This is a Java Spring Boot application that connects to the CoinDCX WebSocket API to fetch real-time trading data for cryptocurrency pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT) and simulates order operations (buy/sell) based on a specified trigger price input by the user. The application runs using a WebSocket connection to receive continuous updates and processes the payload to simulate order creation.

Features:
Real-time market data streaming via WebSocket.
Simulate order creation based on a specified trigger price.
Graceful error handling and logging for WebSocket connections.
Command-line interface for input and output.
Clean code with a focus on error handling and logging.
